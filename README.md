pyirsdk is a clone of https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk.git thanks to Mihail Latyshov


So please do not use this repo but go to see Mihail's instead.

One may not want to have a look at this proof of concept. This github is only made not to loose what I've found.

I'm building my own 3DOF simulator and do not want to use Xsim of such hudge tools as I find them overkill.

Run iRacing FIRST
Then run py -3 test.py
